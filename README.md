# Show Repo

## Installation
Run `pip install git+https://github.com/adamhoffstein/show_repo.git`

## Usage
Simply type `sr` in any directory to see which child repos have uncommitted changes. You can also specify a path in the same manner as the `ls` command. However, there seems to be a bug with pressing tab to autocomplete the specified path.
